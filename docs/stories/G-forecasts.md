# Epic G: daily forecasts (a secondary diagnostic)

Roles: statistician (owner), quantitative modeller, volatility trader, mathematician. Goal: every book answers five
frozen probability questions each session day, scored against frozen point-in-time baselines, as a diagnostic of
market reading that can never promote an unprofitable book (design 12.7, 12.8). Story template, definition of done
and the full story index: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## G1. Forecast protocol and the 30-day ATM implied-volatility estimator

**Repository:** trading

**Description:** As the statistician, I want the five questions, their exact targets, the scoring rules and the
multiplicity adjustment frozen in a protocol before any forecast is scored, so that forecast results cannot be
reshaped after the fact.

**Context and why:** Design 12.7 questions: (1) P(NIFTY close in 20 trading days > today's close); (2)
P(|NIFTY return over the next 20 trading days| >= 3%); (3) P(next-20-day annualised realised volatility > trailing
20-day realised volatility today); (4) P(India VIX close in 10 trading days > today's close); (5) P(next-20-day
annualised realised volatility < today's 30-day at-the-money implied volatility). Scoring: Brier for all, log score
with probabilities clipped to [0.01, 0.99], calibration tables, pairwise differences by forecast date with a
moving-block bootstrap of block length 20 trading days, multiplicity fixed before scoring. Review 19 left the exact
30-day ATM IV estimator to story level. Forecasts start earlier than trading (12.11).

**Scope.** In: the protocol document, exact target definitions, the 30-day ATM IV estimator, the frozen multiplicity
method, the forecast record schema. Out: producing forecasts (G3), baselines (G2), scoring code (G4).

**Expected design:** `research/forecasts/PROTOCOL.md` frozen (FREEZE record with commit and hashes, like B5) and
registered in the ledger (B4). Targets use the session calendar (A1) for "trading days", NIFTY 50 and India VIX closes
(A3 index closes), realised volatility exactly as B1 (root mean square of daily log returns, not demeaned, times
sqrt(252)). **30-day ATM IV:** variance interpolation in time between the two monthly expiries bracketing 30 calendar
days, each expiry's ATM IV from the average of the call and put implied volatilities at the B1 ATM strike (B1 rules
for prices and solver failures); if 30 days is not bracketed, the nearest expiry with at least 7 days, flagged.
Inputs at the forecast cutoff come from the common market pack (E2) for live forecasts and from the panel for
history. Record schema `fno/forecast/schema.py`: `book, date, cutoff, question, probability, method_or_version,
pack_sha256`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. Each target is computed by a reference function that a test checks against hand-worked values on fixture data
   (all five questions, including a holiday inside the window).
2. The 30-day ATM IV estimator matches a hand computation on two fixture days (bracketed and not bracketed).
3. The protocol is frozen and its commit precedes the first scored forecast (checked by G4).
4. The multiplicity method (questions x book pairs) is named with its exact procedure before scoring.

**Test plan:** target and estimator unit tests; freeze-order test.

**Judge verifies:** recomputes one target and one IV value by hand; checks the freeze commit order.

**Depends:** A1, A3, B1, B4 · **Size:** M · **Status:** doing: judge 47 FAIL fixes (golden values, unfreeze), then ChatGPT review before any freeze

## G2. Frozen baselines

**Repository:** trading

**Description:** As the quantitative modeller, I want three baselines computed point-in-time by frozen methods, so that
each book's forecasts are judged against what the market and simple statistics already said.

**Context and why:** Design 12.7: (a) the risk-neutral probabilities implied by NIFTY option prices, labelled
risk-neutral (option prices include risk premia, not real-world probabilities); (b) a historical base rate from a
frozen rolling window; (c) for questions 3-5, a frozen simple statistical model. Book 1's own forecasts come from a
frozen point-in-time method, never refitted after outcomes.

**Scope.** In: the three baselines, their exact methods, the history back-fill for evaluation. Out: AI forecasts.

**Expected design:** `fno/forecast/baselines.py`. (a) Risk-neutral: from the A4 snapshot (live) or panel closes
(history): questions 1 and 2 from the option-implied distribution of the expiry nearest 20 trading days (Breeden-
Litzenberger on call prices with a stated smoothing and interpolation, or the lognormal with the ATM IV as a fallback,
both frozen in G1's protocol); questions 3-5 marked "no risk-neutral equivalent" where none exists (VIX options are not
in the data). (b) Base rate: frequency of the event over the previous 750 trading days (frozen window). (c) Questions
3-5: a frozen simple model (e.g. a HAR-type realised-volatility regression fitted only on data before each forecast
date with a fixed refit schedule), its specification frozen in the protocol.

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. A look-ahead test (B1 harness) proves no baseline uses data after its cutoff.
2. Each baseline reproduces hand-computed values on fixture days.
3. The refit schedule of (c) is fixed and a test proves a refit uses only earlier data.
4. Every baseline value is labelled with its method name and version.

**Test plan:** fixture tests; look-ahead tests.

**Judge verifies:** recomputes one risk-neutral probability and one base rate by hand.

**Depends:** G1, A3, A4 · **Size:** M · **Status:** later

## G3. Book 1 forecast capture

**Repository:** trading

**Description:** As the head of desk, I want Book 1's five probabilities committed each session day by its frozen
method, so that forecast scoring can start before any book trades and before the AI books exist.

**Context and why:** Design 12.7 (Book 1's forecasts come from a frozen point-in-time method, never refitted after
outcomes) and 12.11 (forecasts start earlier than trading). The AI books' forecasts come later with their sessions
(G5; ChatGPT review 26: M3 must not claim three-book forecasts before the AI books exist).

**Scope.** In: Book 1's method, capture, validation, commit. Out: AI books (G5), scoring (G4).

**Expected design:** `fno/forecast/book1_method.py` (frozen; by default the base-rate and statistical baselines
combined by a fixed rule written in the protocol); records validated by `fno/forecast/schema.py` and committed daily
(before the deadline once the desk runs; by the daily routine before then).

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. Book 1 has five probabilities in [0, 1] per session day, or a recorded "no forecast" (missing, never imputed).
2. Book 1's method is identical on every day of a version (hash of the method file in each record).
3. Forecasts committed after the deadline are ignored.

**Test plan:** validation tests; method-hash test.

**Judge verifies:** checks one week of Book-1 forecast files for completeness and commit order.

**Depends:** G1, G2 · **Size:** S · **Status:** later

## G4. Forecast scoring and reports

**Repository:** trading

**Description:** As the statistician, I want each book's forecasts scored against outcomes and baselines with
overlap-aware uncertainty, so that we know who reads the market best, labelled as secondary to profit.

**Context and why:** Design 12.7 and 12.8: Brier, clipped log score, calibration tables, pairwise differences by date
with a 20-day moving-block bootstrap, multiplicity as frozen; forecasts cannot promote an unprofitable book.

**Scope.** In: outcome resolution, scores, calibration, pairwise comparisons, the report section for S4 and the
dashboard. Out: decisions about books (S4 review).

**Expected design:** `fno/forecast/scoring.py`; resolves each forecast when its target date passes (A1 calendar,
A3 closes); computes per book and baseline Brier, log score, calibration bins (fixed edges), and pairwise score
differences with the block bootstrap (seed fixed in the protocol) and the frozen multiplicity adjustment; output
`research/forecasts/scores/<date>.json` for P2.

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. Known-answer tests: Brier and log score on a fixture set match hand values; clipping is applied.
2. The block bootstrap with the fixed seed reproduces a committed interval exactly.
3. A forecast is never scored before its target date is resolvable.
4. Every report labels forecasts as secondary to net profit.

**Test plan:** known-answer tests; determinism tests.

**Judge verifies:** recomputes one book's Brier score for one month.

**Depends:** G1, G3 (G5 for books 2 and 3) · **Size:** M · **Status:** later

## G5. AI books' forecast capture

**Repository:** trading

**Description:** As the statistician, I want books 2 and 3 to answer the same five questions in their isolated
sessions every session day, so that all three books are compared on forecasts too.

**Context and why:** Design 12.7 (all books answer the five questions every trading day); F1 (isolated sessions,
receipt and promotion deadlines). Split from G3 after ChatGPT review 26.

**Scope.** In: the forecast part of the AI books' session output, validation, commit; G4 reports missing AI forecasts
before this story is done as "not yet running", never as zero skill. Out: scoring (G4).

**Expected design:** the AI book's session output (F1) includes `forecasts`; validated by `fno/forecast/schema.py` and
committed with the decision before the promotion deadline.

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. Each AI book has five probabilities per session day, or a recorded "no forecast".
2. Forecasts received after the receipt deadline are ignored.
3. G4's report shows each book's coverage (days with forecasts / session days).

**Test plan:** validation tests with fake session outputs.

**Judge verifies:** checks one week of AI-book forecast files.

**Depends:** G1, G3, F1 · **Size:** S · **Status:** later
